              Azlan Shah is my roommate when I was studying in the States. When things got tough, we both got each other
              and I know he can always count on him which explained why he’s the best man on my big day. He’s more
              commonly known as Asai among his close friends.

              One of the first few friends he made in US. Being the one who helped him settled down in US made him one
              of the closest friends to date. When I first knew him, he told me that he was from Sarawak and in my mind,
              he got the Sarawakian accent. But things got interesting when he’s more fluent in Utagha slang more than
              Sarawak.

              I started to know him about 1 month before I went to Stevens. Back then we were just an acquaintance and
              saying hello was the only thing we said to each other. Little that I know that he became one of the
              friends that I always turned to when I need a critical thinker.  One of the memories that I cherish
              together is when Hurricane Sandy came to NY/NJ area, all basic needs were gone and we were unprepared. But
              he said nothing can go wrong when you have Halal Kentucky Fried Chicken. So we bought KFC as much as we
              could and thank God we did that as Sandy hurricane caused us 10 days without electricity and domestic
              supply.

              Two is better than one. And that’s why this twin has a favorite place in my heart. Knowing them since
              kindergarten days made them one of the closest friend of all time. Super talented fellas. This twin has
              taught me so much in friendship. When others turned themselves away, these two will always have my back no
              matter what may come and believe me when I say things can never go wrong when they’re around.

              Super genius, toughbuilt, funny, and good looking lad. Back in primary school days, having a class next to
              him gave me the opportunity to secretly measure myself next to him (during assembly) hoping that I will
              grow if not taller, at least the same height with him. Secretly measuring our shoes is one of the way
              seeing myself looking at our height. It doesn’t take me that long to realize the fact that everyone is
              different. After completing his studies in Canada, he furthered his studies again in Kings College and
              currently pursuing his career as a project engineer.

              Mad and I went long way back from standard one. We were in the same class for 4 years before he was
              transferred to a different school. Few years later, we met again when we registered in the same school.
              Mad is one of those friends who always think outside the box. His creativity and enthusiasm in everything
              he does landed him in Japan for his undergraduate years. He is now a proud co-founder of The Tokyo Burger
              (@thetokyoburger.co) and on his way to a great food empire.

              Yusof spent most of his childhood in England and because of that, we only knew each other since junior
              high school. He didn't speak much back then but he surely knows how to blend in with everyone. We were in
              the same class when we were in Form 3 and guess what, he pulled one of the greatest prank in my life when
              he left me sleeping in class and proceed to Science lab with other classmates which in the end landed me
              into another discipline case. Damn. Even though life takes us to different ways, we always  catch up every
              now and then. Yusof now is also one of @thetokyoburger.co family and currently doing some work experience
              side by side with Mad.
