      <blockquote style="text-align: left;">
        Our friendship went way back in 2010 where the conversation went around football only as Nafis is a diehard
        fan of Liverpool FC and Luqman is nothing but a Manchester United fan. Fast forward to 2013, we realised
        that our friendship is special because we instantly clicked the first time we met and we thought that only
        happen in movies. Somehow, we were lucky enough it happened to us and from football, we can now talk about
        other things especially Lomography. Nafis has been collecting lomo cameras for a year and has been
        experimenting with it for quite some time. The photography enthusiast, Luqman wanted to be the cool kids
        as well, so he started learning Lomography from Nafis. Not long after Lomography studies, Luqman went to
        the States to be a civil engineer and Nafis stayed in Malaysia to be a ‘certified’ foodie. Cut short,
        from snapping random photos in Holga to our first analog photo with SX 70 Polaroid, is when we realise
        being more than friends is cool.
